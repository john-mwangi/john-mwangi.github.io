      <description>Iâ€™m a data analytics specialist with interests in: data science, machine learning, deep learning, statistics, business intelligence, analytics, data engineering, ML Ops, and data governance.
I have a little over 10 years&#39; experience (as at 2021) and over the time, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the good fortune of doing a very wide variety of projects: started as a consultant with one of the Big Four firms doing technology audits, transitioned to technology advisory focusing on tech strategy development, system implementations, and data analytics, moved to a tier 1 bank doing data governance, moved back to consulting and did a lot of ML and BI projects, then joined a start-up focusing on application of ML and statistics in Behavioural Science.</description>
